1. Algorithms Dealing with a Single Array
 Find the maximum value in an array.
 Calculate the average of students in a class of n students for a given subject.
(An element of the array is a structure with 2 fields: Name and Grade.)
 Calculate the value of a polynomial P(X) of a given degree n using the array
of its coefficients for a given value of X.
